<h2 id="head-9c4fb0cacc9f995ccfa607c65c2538db235638ce">Pending Queue</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line891"><span class="strike">* Create a <a class="http" href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.mail.spam.tmda.devel/5949">pending queue abstraction</a> to support more than just one type of queue structure for "pending" messages, and allow sites with specific needs to write their own pending queue description.</span> <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><p class="line891"><span class="strike">* Once the above is done, a <a class="nonexistent" href="./MaildirQueue.html">MaildirQueue</a>, which is a <a class="http" href="http://www.courier-mta.org/imap/?README.maildirquota.html">Maildir++</a> compatible pending queue.  The performance of such a queue will be slightly worse than the current, but it will be more reliable and compatible with many mail readers, IMAP servers, etc and allow system administrator to enforce disk quotas.</span> <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span></li><li class="gap">Another idea is a MySQLQueue, where the pending queue is actually a MySQL db.  I'd need to bone up on my knowledge of MySQL first though. <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span></li><li class="gap">Similarily, a "sender-based pending queue" where the messages are organized in subfolders based on sender, so that multiple messages can be released with one confirmation.   The question is whether we should separate the structure from the functionality or not.  I think I'd rather have the option to release all messages from a sender regardless of what format the pending queue is in.   <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span></li><li class="gap">Also write conversion code that automatically converts a user's pending queue for them.  If the available formats are say 'original', 'maildir', and 'mysql', the user can specify which storage format he wants in the .tmda/config.  If tmda-filter tries to deliver to the queue and notices it's not in the right format, the pending queue will be converted to the target format, and then delivery resumed.  <span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><p class="line891"><span class="strike">The question is how to do this safely.  How about borrowing an idea from <a class="http" href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/dot-qmail.html">dot-qmail</a> -- if the sticky bit is set on $HOME, TMDA will defer message delivery until the directory isn't sticky any longer.  So the code can turn this on, perform the conversion, and then turn it off again.  It will also provide a nice feature for users who wish to defer delivery by hand.  They can <strong>chmod +t $HOME</strong> and <strong>chmod -t $HOME</strong> to stop and restart delivery.</span> <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><p class="line862">The other question is how to handle the transfer of messages from one pending queue format to another, which may be wildly different (e.g, a SQL db to a Maildir).  Since allot of the code seems to pass around messages as email.Message objects, perhaps we could just serialize each message object using <tt class="backtick">pickle</tt>, write them into MAILID.pck files in a temp directory <tt class="backtick">tempfile.mkdtemp</tt>, then unserialize them and insert them into the new queue one by one. <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><p class="line891"><span class="strike">* This might be open for debate, but I'm considering removing the :3,R and :3,C status of released/confirmed pending messages.  Messages will simply be unlinked after release or confirm.  My reasoning is that this makes the code extremely complex with little to no benefit.  It is also non-intuitive behavior, as users expect the message to be deleted after release/confirm (see FAQ 4.4).</span> <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">

This is also on Mailman's TODO list for 2.2, so we might be able to just steal their code. <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><p class="line891"><span class="strike">* Remove BOUNCE_TEXT_* and CONFIRM_ACCEPT_* in favour of multiple templates, one for each condition. This might mean some content duplication in the template collection and more editing, but it's much simpler.  It also makes things much easier for users of non-english templates.</span> <span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span></li></ul><p class="line867">

From it's description, it seems like it might. For one thing, it might simplify Util.pipecmd() which is used heavily in TMDA. <span class="anchor" id="line-141"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-142"></span></li><li class="gap">Lazy body processing.
