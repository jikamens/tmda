<h2 id="head-954f39a635f2c0941ca53cfd3c30a75349055fb0">What is it?</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><p class="line862">tmda-ofmipd allows users of any mail client capable of SMTP Authentication (e.g, Outlook, Eudora, Mozilla) to "tag" their outgoing mail as described in the <a href="./ClientConfiguration.html">ClientConfiguration</a> section. <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><p class="line862">In this document, mail clients are referred to as an MUA, which stands for "Mail User Agent". The name <a class="http" href="http://cr.yp.to/proto/ofmip.html">ofmip</a> stands for "Old Fashioned Mail Injection Protocol" <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><p class="line874">tmda-ofmipd can either accept SMTP connections directly on an available port (e.g, 8025), or can be triggered by another server such as xinetd or tcpserver. When a connection is received, tmda-ofmipd authenticates the user, and looks up the user's TMDA configuration. For each message that is received, the message is processed according to the user's outgoing filter. <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><p class="line874">Once the message has been processed, tmda-ofmipd simply forwards it to some existing SMTP server. This is why it's known as a "proxy" - tmda-ofmipd does not replace the real SMTP server; rather it accepts the message from the client, transforms the headers etc., and then sends the message by handing it off to the real SMTP server.  <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><p class="line874">There are several reasons why you may want to (or have to) use tmda-ofmipd to take advantage of TMDA's client features: <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><ul><li>Your MUA doesn't support a /usr/sbin/sendmail interface, but rather uses direct SMTP to send mail. This includes practically all non-Unix mail clients, and even some Unix clients such as Thunderbird or Mozilla. <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span></li><li class="gap">You want to maintain your TMDA configuration in one central location instead of on each individual machine that you use. Unless all your machines share a home directory via NFS or somesuch, this isn't trivial. tmda-ofmipd allows you to maintain only one set of files - on the server on which tmda-ofmipd runs. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><p class="line867">

<h3 id="head-a4db36202e95c223b12e74b0e8c9e74b3354f1f8">Authentication Sources</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><p class="line874">tmda-ofmipd can get its authentication information from several different sources. <span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><ol type="1"><li>From a "password" file that you create. The format of this file is simple. Each line of the file should contain a username and password separated by a colon; one entry per line. e.g, <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><pre>bobby:FooBar
<span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span>chloe:baz_bap
<span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span>johndoe:8i9/hjuy+33</pre><span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span>The username fields should match the usernames of the TMDA users on your mail server. <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span>The passwords need not be the same as any other passwords on the system. In fact, for security reasons, they should remain distinct!  <span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span>The default location for the authentication file /etc/tofmipd if running in global mode (see below), otherwise ~user/.tmda/tofmipd. These defaults can be overridden using tmda-ofmipd's '-a' flag.  <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span>The authentication file must be chmod 600 or 400, and be owned by the user running the daemon. tmda-ofmipd will fail to start otherwise.  <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span></li><li class="gap"><p class="line862">A checkpassword compatible programs such as <a class="http" href="http://checkpasswd-pam.sourceforge.net/">checkpassword-pam</a>. This would allow you to utilize your existing password database. Use tmda-ofmipd's '-A' flag to specify the program and arguments. The help output contains such an example.  <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span></li><li class="gap">Against a remote resource such as POP3, IMAP, or LDAP server. Use tmda-ofmipd's '-R' flag to specify the protocol, and optionally the hostname and port of the server. See the help output for supported protocols and example usage. <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span></li></ol><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="head-dea98855da631959d3d2add8a96e89c5b3f39800">Builtin SSL/TLS</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><p class="line862">Recent versions of tmda-ofmipd have builtin support for SSL, removing the need to use stunnel. To use this support, you will need to install the tlslite Python module. tmda-ofmipd was developed and tested with version 0.3.8. The primary distribution site for tlslite is <a class="http" href="http://trevp.net/tlslite/">http://trevp.net/tlslite/</a>. However, if you run tmda-ofmipd under Python 2.5, you need to use a patched version of tlslite, available from <a class="http" href="http://www.wwwdotorg.org/tlslite/">http://www.wwwdotorg.org/tlslite/</a>. <span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><p class="line874">SSL support works in two main modes: <span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span><ol type="1"><li>--ssl: The first is SMTP-over-SSL (also known as SMTPS, or TLS-wrapper mode in postfix terminology). In this mode, the SSL connection is immediately negotiated when the client connects. Once SSL negotiation has completed, a standard SMTP communication occurs inside the SSL connection. Port 465 is typically used in this case. <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span></li><li class="gap">--tls: The second mode is TLS/STARTTLS mode. In this mode, a plain-text SMTP connection is initially made. At some point, the SMTP client will issue the STARTTLS command, at which point SSL negotiation will occur, and any subsequent communication will be encrypted. Port 587 (submission) is typically used in this case. Note that --tls requires an argument; see below. <span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-71"></span></li></ol><p class="line874">Further, --tls mode supports two sub-options. Specifically, usage of the STARTTLS command can be configured to be either optional or mandatory. <span class="anchor" id="line-72"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-73"></span><ol type="1"><li>--tls=optional: If STARTTLS is optional, an SMTP client can completely ignore TLS support, and send email using a purely plain-text SMTP connection with absolutely no impact. This can be useful when initially rolling out SSL support; clients are not immediately forced to reconfigure and/or upgrade their MUAs because of the server-side change. <span class="anchor" id="line-74"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-75"></span></li><li class="gap">--tls=on: Secure sites will typically choose mandatory usage of STARTTLS. In this configuration, very few SMTP commands are accepted prior to invocation of STARTTLS. This prevents any authentication, or mail injection, from occuring over an unencrypted connection. This is intended to ensure that no passwords pass through an unencrypted connection. The option --tls=on enables this mode. <span class="anchor" id="line-76"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-77"></span></li></ol><p class="line874">Theoretically, some AUTH methods are safe even over unencrypted connections. However, tmda-ofmipd does not currently support offering such AUTH mechanisms prior to STARTTLS, but allowing a different set of AUTH mechanisms after STARTTLS. <span class="anchor" id="line-78"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-79"></span><p class="line874">In all modes, tmda-ofmipd requires access to an SSL private key and SSL certificate file. Use the --ssl-key=/some/path.key and --ssl-cert=/some/path.crt command-line options to configure the relevant filenames. <span class="anchor" id="line-80"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-81"></span><p class="line874">The key and certificate files should be created in the standard way, most likely using OpenSSL. The file format required is exactly the same as any other SSL server, such as Apache, Dovecot, etc. <span class="anchor" id="line-82"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-83"></span><p class="line867">

<h4 id="head-3e56c8ea0fd5cd0257adc1128dec9af74677187e">Encryption acceleration package required</h4>
<span class="anchor" id="line-86"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-87"></span><p class="line874">SSL supports a number of different encryption schemes. tlslite includes a Python implementation of some of these. However, the Python code doesn't implement all possible encryption schemes, simply because some encryption schemes would run insanely slowly if written in Python. <span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><p class="line874">Some mail clients don't support all possible encryption schemes. If tlslite and your mail client don't both support at least one common encryption scheme, you won't be able to negotiate an SSL connection. So far, this has been observed with the Evolution client, which requires that the server support 3DES. <span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span><p class="line874">tlslite support various "encryption acceleration" packages written in C. These packages not only provide much higher encryption throughput, but also implement the 3DES encryption scheme. This will allow Evolution to connect. tlslite supports a variety of different acceleration packages; see the documentation for details. The pycrypto package has been tested by TMDA developers and appears to work well. <span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span><p class="line867">

<h3 id="head-7bcc03211754d9028de4a879953c1db9625a6258">Starting tmda-ofmipd</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-136"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-137"></span><p class="line874">tmda-ofmipd can run either as a standalone daemon, or run in "one-session" mode. <span class="anchor" id="line-138"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-139"></span><p class="line874">When run as a standalone daemon, tmda-ofmipd will listen for connections on the port you specify, accept those connections directly, and handle those connections as described in the introduction. <span class="anchor" id="line-140"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-141"></span><p class="line874">In "one-session" mode, a separate application, such as xinetd or tcpserver, is expected to listen for, and accept, incoming socket connections, and then spawn tmda-ofmipd to handle the connection. <span class="anchor" id="line-142"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-143"></span><p class="line874">Some advantages of "one-session" mode are: <span class="anchor" id="line-144"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-145"></span><ul><li>You can run tmda-ofmipd the same way as other network applications, for more consistent management (e.g. re-using xinetd's connection rate control features, or any tcpwrappers configuration, etc.) <span class="anchor" id="line-146"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-147"></span></li><li class="gap">tmda-ofmipd doesn't currently handle SSL directly. To use SSL, you need to use another application such as stunnel. Typically, stunnel will accept the network connection, and make a "loopback" connection to tmda-ofmipd. In this scenario, tmda-ofmipd cannot know the client's IP address, and does not place useful information into the "Received" header it adds to messages. In "one-session" mode, tmda-ofmipd can pick up and use environment variables set by xinetd/tcpserver for this information. <span class="anchor" id="line-148"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-149"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">Note that becaue "one-session" mode requires configuring an application such as xinetd to spawn tmda-ofmipd, and (typically) xinetd can only be configured by a system administrator, "one-session" mode will typically be used only in "global mode" as described above. However, a combination of a user-controlled "socket server" application such as stunnel running on a non-privileged port, and tmda-ofmipd in "personal" mode should work, but has not been tested. <span class="anchor" id="line-150"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-151"></span><p class="line867">
