If it doesn't appeal, they don't participate, which leaves those of us who read and write to get on with rational discourse. <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span></li><li class="gap">wiki is far from real time.

So what people write is well-considered. <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span></li><li class="gap">wiki participants are, by nature, a pedantic, ornery, and unreasonable bunch.

A vandal could post an edit that couples an insightful comment with the introduction of random typos and word deletions or insertions that degrades the quality of the page without destroying it.  (Such behavior could even be automated.)  By the time such damage is typically discovered, it will be intermixed with a series of valid changes to the page, making fixing things into a painful merge rather than a simple rollback. <span class="anchor" id="line-209"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-210"></span><p class="line874">While the level of individual with the time and dedication to do such, coupled with the sociopathic instinct to destroy things others enjoy, is a fairly rare occurrence, the internet age has taught us that such pathological individuals do exist, and that they can affect computers anywhere in the world.

<h2 id="head-c6b1f3b7cf70b9c7ddf56b5c41bd9bf7e70e8923">4. Why Wikis Don't Work as Well as We Think They Do</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-228"></span><p class="line874">Having installed two wiki's (one for work, one for a class), I believe there are some usability issues that prevent them from fulfilling their promise.   Assume that most people are not going to invest 20 minutes or more of their time to understand formatting unless there's a big payoff for them. I offer this in the hopes that we can all think about how to solve these problems: <span class="anchor" id="line-229"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-230"></span><p class="line874">1)  People don't use wiki's because they don't realize they can actually make changes.  I've found that most of my wiki's audience (participants?) bring a broadcast mindset to anything on the web.  The idea that they can make changes is totally foreign to them and they're anxious at first when it comes to "talking back."    "Sandboxes" don't seem to be sufficient to get people over the hump.  We need something else... <span class="anchor" id="line-231"></span><ul><li><p class="line862">That is not a problem of technology, but of people not knowing wikis. But for your work companions and students: you did tell them that they CAN make changes? I think this is more of a problem of people coming in via search engines, not realizing that they got into a wiki. One solution for them could be to display a one-time notice "Hey, you have found a great new EDITABLE web site" if they don't have a special cookie (NOWIKINEWBIEANYMORE=1). <em>I can understand wanting to force co-workers to use a local wiki, but making random people who came in on a search engine and aren't tuned-in enough with reality to notice that they can edit the page they're reading may be more trouble than it's worth.</em> <span class="anchor" id="line-232"></span></li><li><p class="line862">Spread the word! <img alt=";)" height="15" src="./mentalwealth/img/smile4.png" title=";)" width="15" /> <em>This sounds like a much more productive approach to hooking people into wiki... but there are already enough wikis that have reached critical mass.  Is wiki evangelism even necessary at this point (January 2004)?</em> <span class="anchor" id="line-233"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-234"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">2)  Strangely enough, the "free-form" aspect of wiki isn't free form enough.  There's no way to easily create columns.  I looked at wiki's originally as a way of blogging.  Most blogs are two or three columns, but only one column could be powered by a wiki, the others I had to do in HTML.  I wish I didn't have to make this compromise.  Maybe columns isn't the answer, maybe tables are because that's really what columns are made out of in HTML... <span class="anchor" id="line-235"></span><ul><li>If you have concrete ideas of how to improve that, tell us. Do you know some method of doing multi-column text without having to make (mostly wrong) assumptions about screen and font size? But: we won't make a design that's "optimized for 800x600 and IE". @) <span class="anchor" id="line-236"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-237"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">I work in an ad agency and we deal in short attention spans.  We need to design better ways to accommodate these short attention spans at the initial stage of using a wiki.

Slashdot-like systems leverage the chaos and impose just enough organization to avoid breakdown.  It could be that wikis need some of the same control mechanisms to really work well on a larger scale. <span class="anchor" id="line-279"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-280"></span><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-281"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-282"></span><p class="line874">How to sabotage this system <span class="anchor" id="line-283"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-284"></span><p class="line874">Look for opinions.
