Please note; I'm not sure, if this is 100% accurate in all cases.

<h3 id="head-47aa26a07c9d7a688057943ef7a42131ff61f94c">Using Fetchmail and TMDA with a catch-all e-mail address</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-149"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-150"></span><p class="line874">Many hosting companies allow users to specify a catch-all address for domains hosted on the company's shared hosting servers.  This catch-all address generally receives all e-mail sent to the hosted domain that isn't explicitly delivered to a mailbox or forwarding address. <span class="anchor" id="line-151"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-152"></span><p class="line874">This is very convenient for those using TMDA as all the dated, keyword, and whatnot addresses will all dump into the catch-all address.  However, not all addresses and hosting companies are created equally.  As such, using the approach suggested above will only get you so far. <span class="anchor" id="line-153"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-154"></span><p class="line874">For instance, while e-mail sent to my primary e-mail address worked just fine with TMDA, e-mail sent to other virtual addresses that were configured to pass through TMDA for delivery would always trigger confirmation. <span class="anchor" id="line-155"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-156"></span><p class="line874">The solution I found after much experimentation and rooting around online was to add the following to my .procmailrc file: <span class="anchor" id="line-157"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-158"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-159"></span><pre>RECIPIENT=`formail  -UDelivered-to: -xDelivered-To: | perl  -e '$_=&lt;STDIN&gt;;s#\sdbogen-example:com-##;print "$_";'`
<span class="anchor" id="line-160"></span>:0fw
<span class="anchor" id="line-161"></span>| formail -i "X-Procmail-Recipient:  $RECIPIENT"
<span class="anchor" id="line-162"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-163"></span>:0fw
<span class="anchor" id="line-164"></span>| /usr/local/bin/xtmdaheader $RECIPIENT
<span class="anchor" id="line-165"></span>
<span class="anchor" id="line-166"></span># Run the message through tmda-filter.
<span class="anchor" id="line-167"></span></pre><span class="anchor" id="line-168"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-169"></span><p class="line874">This uses formail to isolate the last Delivered-To: header in the message. From this I can derive the address to which the message was originally delivered.  perl is used to strip out the part of the Delivered-To: header I don't want, which leaves me with just the e-mail address to which the message was originally delivered.  Obviously, you'll need to remove/replace the dbogen-example:com from the perl code before it will work for you.  In addition, if your hosting company uses a different scheme for their Delivered-To: headers, you may need to tweak the perl regexp to get something that works for you.  You may need to examine the headers of some messages, and experiment with the commands above before implementing anything in a live environment. <span class="anchor" id="line-170"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-171"></span><p class="line874">Then, I add this information to the messages headers for later debugging, if necessary. <span class="anchor" id="line-172"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-173"></span><p class="line874">Finally, I call xtmdaheader as described above with the value we derived from header parsing. <span class="anchor" id="line-174"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-175"></span><p class="line874">I won't guarantee that this is the Right Way to solve this problem, but it works for me.  You can contact me at djb at bogen org if you have questions about this. <span class="anchor" id="line-176"></span><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
