The online TMDA documentation is on the wiki @ http://wiki.tmda.net/
Normally the Wiki tracks the most recent release of TMDA which you may
not be running.  These files are a snapshot of the wiki at the time a
release was made.  This allows you to maintain a local copy of the
documentation that matches your release.
